TODO(1): Clearly model the bijection with any n-ary tree to a binary tree.
	 Use this to model in general arbitrary computations by a binary tree
	 Of a process and it's continuation at level l. Figure out how to
	 reconcile the levels and the values that are common. (i.e. the
	 minimum/sum/maximum over all children of n-ary tree). Use 2 depths?
	 binary tree depth vs n-ary tree depth and use this to perform the
	 desired operations. (AWESOME).

TODO(1): Finish maximum independent set implementation. (Tree representation).

TODO(Inf): program an LP solver to figure out some parameters for
	kernel configuration for work stealing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DONE: Implement work stealing algorithm at the SM level.
DONE: Implement lock-free work-stealing circular-buffer deque.
